# Project Details

## Overview

In the final project you will apply what you've learned in the course to a problem you're interested in. The final project is an opportunity to not only apply what you've learned but to build your portfolio and gain experience on a real problem. The project will be individual effort but you're encouraged to talk with the instructor and classmates. 

The project should be in an area you're interested in. This could be work related or an area you'd like to explore. If you need some ideas to get started look at previously completed projects and publicly available datasets. Note that you will need to provide your analysis and data for review so be careful if the data is private.

There will be several milestones and deliverables required throughout the course ending in a final paper and presentation. 

## Deliverables

* Paper: A final paper describing the end to end steps of the project 
* Presentation: A final presentation covering the project
* Code: All code used for the project (data gathering, exploration, modelling, etc)
* Data: All data sets used
* Data Description: A description of the data set used. Include where you got it from and a description of the columns

## Project Milestones

### Project Proposal

Create a GitHub repository for your project and include a short description answering the following questions:
* What is the problem statement?
* What is your objective?
* What data will you use?
* Why did you choose this topic?

### Elevator Speech

You will give a short presentation (<2 minutes) of your proposal to the class. This should include:
* Statement of problem and objectives
* What questions you'd like to answer
* What data sets you'll be using
* How you will approach this problem
* Why you chose this topic

### Paper Draft 

This will be your final write up describing your end to end analysis. It should include sections for:
* Summary and problem statement
* Description of data and collection method
* Exploration, pre-processing, and feature analysis, including visualizations
* Modeling process, testing, and validation
* Results
* Conclusion (challenges, successes, next steps, etc)


### Presentation

You will give a final presentation to the class. Submit all required deliverables before the presentation date.

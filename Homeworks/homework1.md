# Homework 1

This homework assignment will use the titanic_train data set found in the dataset folder. You will have a week to complete this assignment. Do all your analysis and answer the questions within a Jupyter notebook. Put the notebook in your GitHub's homework repository.

1. Read the titanic data set into a pandas dataframe.
2. Look at the first 5 rows.
3. What is the size of the data set? (rows and columns)
4. How many people survived? What percentage of people survived?
5. What percentage of passengers are male? female?
6. What is the survival rate of male passengers? female passengers?
7. How many different cabin classes, Pclass, are there? 
8. What percent of the passengers are in each class?
9. What is the survival rate within each class? 
10. Create a histogram of ages split by sex and survival.
11. Create a boxplot for age split by class and sex.
12. For each class create a histogram plot of ages split by suvivor or not. ( You will have one figure for each class. Each figure will have two histograms on it. One for survivors and one for non-survivors where the survivors are colored blue and non-survivors colored red) 
13. Discuss anything interesting you found. Where there any surprises? Are there any data issues you found? If you wanted to predict survival or not what do you think we be the most useful?
